The second file was harder to come up with a creative name.  
I ended up creating both of them with Cleveland sports team names.
Windians is the nickname that they give the baseball team 
when they're doing well/winning.  I didnt even bother with the 
Browns because they're really bad and I don't even like football all 
that much.  I'm more of a soccer player.
